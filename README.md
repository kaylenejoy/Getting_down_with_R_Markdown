# Getting Down with R Markdown
An introduction to R Markdown and a collaborative coding challenge exploring NYC parties

### Summary
This content was developed for the December 2017 R Ladies Chicago meetup. There were two parts to this meet up---first was a 20-minute presentation on R Markdown, and then we broke into small groups for a collaborative coding challenge. Groups then spent an hour exploring data on party-related noise complaints in NYC, which includes party-related noise complaints in NYC (including their time and location within the city) and neighborhood-level demographics. They compiled what they found into an R Markdown report and shared with the rest of the group.  

This repository contains both the presentation on R Markdown as well as the data that we used for the coding challenge. More details about the coding challenge and NYC party data can be found in the R Markdown presentation.

### What's Inside
The R Markdown presentation (and the .Rmd file that produce this presentation) are located in [/presentation](https://github.com/kaylenejoy/Getting_down_with_R_Markdown/tree/master/data)
Data about NYC parties data available in [/data](https://github.com/kaylenejoy/Getting_down_with_R_Markdown/tree/master/data). Raw data and the script used to join the data available in the [/raw_data](https://github.com/kaylenejoy/Getting_down_with_R_Markdown/tree/master/data/raw_data) subfolder. 

### Thank you!
Shout out to [Evgeniy Vasilev](https://www.kaggle.com/somesnm) for posting the NYC party-related noise complaints from 2016 on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/somesnm/partynyc).  I joined this data with [NYC neighborhood-level demographic data](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/NYC+Geographies) which is available from the Baruch College Library thanks to [Frank Donnelly](http://guides.newman.baruch.cuny.edu/prf.php?account_id=23385).

Thank you to [R Ladies Chicago](https://github.com/rladies-chicago) for making this possible and many thanks to all the members who attended and participated!
